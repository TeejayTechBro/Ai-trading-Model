# stock-correlations-casestudy
A case study of the Pearson correlation coefficient between daily prices for different stocks. In the Jupyter Notebook, it will be shown a case study of correlations. It will be measured the Pearson correlation coefficient for the close prices of two different stocks (variables X and Y) at the same day and analyze what can this number show us about their relationships. This coefficient is simply a number that goes from -1 to 1, giving a measurement of how those variables (in this case, daily stock prices for different stocks) vary together. If the prices are positively correlated, this number will be close to positive 1, and if they are negatively correlated, it will be close to negative -1. If the relationship isn't too strong, this number will have a relatively low absolute value.
